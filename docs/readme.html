<h1>Path Planning (AI) in Platformer Games: A Layered Approach</h1>

<p>
I've been working on path planning (path finding) for platformer games
for a while. My original intention was to create a reusable framework
for scripting characters in a platformer, but it can have other
interesting applications. I have a working prototype and its source
code.

<h2>Handling Continuous Space</h2>

<p>
The first problem that we need to address is the continuous nature of
a platformer game. In a typical path planning, a problem is usually
represpented as a discrete space. However, in a platformer game where
characters often are affected by gravity, handling its continuous
movement is crucial. We addressed this issue by dividing the problem
into two layers: macro-level planning and micro-level planning. The
macro-level planning takes care of a coarse-grained plan such as "go
to this block" or "jump here and try to land at that block". The
micro-level planning takes care of more fine-tuned movement that
involves a continuous 2-D space. The macro-level planning is done by
using typical AI techniques like a navigation mesh, constructing a set
of possible actions at each discrete location. The micro-level
planning is done in a more greedy manner, by taking care of physical
collisions and character coordinates.

<p>
The macro-level planning can be implemented with a pretty
straightforward Dijkstra or A* search. It starts from the goal
position, and iteratively searches all the possible movements until it
reaches the initial state (the position of the character).  Each
action is associated to its next action until it reaches the goal,
forming a DAG structure. A plan graph can be dynamically constructed
and periodically updated based on the current state of the game.
Additional restrictions (e.g. space constraints and ladders) are also
considered.

<p>
When each action is executed, a character is entirely controlled by
that action, and the character cannot execute the next action until
the current action is finished. Each action only considers the
starting and ending point, and it moves the character in a rather
straightforward way.  When the macro-level planner detects the
situation change (e.g. the goal is moved) during the execution, the
current plan is abandaned after the action is finished and a new plan
graph is created.

<h2>Jumping / Falling</h2>

<p>
Jumping and falling is the key element of platformer games and the
core of its planning problem. It has so many parameters that using
naive methods will easily lead to computational explosion. In the
proposed method, the macro-level planner only takes care of its
starting point and ending point in the block coordinates. The planner
has to know in advance the speed of a character in question and its
jump impulse, as well as the gravity acceleration, so that it can know
where it will exactly land. The macro-level planner uses two bounding
boxes (a jumping part and a falling part) to approximate the clearance
that a character needs, but it doesn't take care of an actual
trajectory of the character.

<p>
An actual jump action is divided into three steps.  First, it tries to
move the character to its starting position (Set), maneuver the
character movement during ascending (Ascend), and then land the
character to the ending position (Land).  It takes a precise
(pixel-wise) control of the character at each frame update.

<h2>Landing Prediction</h2>

<p>
The planner can find a solution only when the path planning is
solvable. When a character is following another character that is
jumping or falling, the goal position is often considered unreachable,
making it impossible to find a solution. In a case like this, the
planner can optionally make a guess of the final landing position
based on the current speed of the character.

<h2>Moving Platforms, Sprinting, Double Jumping, etc.</h2>

<p>
A path finding is based on an assumption that the floor map
you're planning on is static. When there are some parts that are
changing dynamically, those parts need to be handled specially by 
the micro-level planner. In this case, the macro-level planner only 
takes care of moving into that part and getting out of it.

<p>

<p>
Handling moves like sprinting or double jumping can be more tricky,
because such actions depend on the current state of a character.  In
other words, a plan becomes context-dependent. Now we would have
to consider multiple possible states at each grid, making the search
space several times larger. I am not sure if we can find a really good
solution for this kind of planning, but in theory we can still take
this into account in the current framework.

<h2>Source Code Structure</h2>

<p>
The prototype is written in ActionScript. However, the planning parts
are separated from the UI and I believe it's relatively easy to port them to
another language. Here are a couple of important classes:

<dl>
<dt> <code>Actor</code>
<dd> This is an object that the planner takes control of.
  The object needs to support methods like <code>move(x, y)</code>, <code>jump()</code>
  to perform actions on each character, as well as query methods such as 
  <code>bounds()</code>.

<dt> <code>TileMap</code>
<dd> An object that stores a 2D map that a planner can use.
  This is basically a two dimensional array of tile numbers.
  The class needs to handle a query like <code>getTile(x, y)</code> as well as
  range queries like "if there's a certain block within this area" in order to
  serve the efficient planning.

<dt> <code>PlanMap</code>
<dd> A macro-level planner that has a plan graph and its constructor.
  It maintains a grid of actions, which correspond to each tile in 
  a <code>TileMap</code> object, so that an <code>Actor</code> can query
  a possible action to take at each place. An action, 
  which is a <code>PlanAction</code> object, is represented as 
  an edge of a plan graph. There's one important method <code>addPlan()</code>,
  which fills the grid according to the given parameters and the associated
  <code>TileMap</code>.
  A plan graph can be shared and reused as long as the goal is not changed
  and all the <code>Actor</code>s has the same property (e.g. speed, gravity, etc.).

<dt> <code>PlanAction</code>
<dd> This object represents a single action planned by the macro-level planner.
  An action object has a detailed information about the action such as a
  starting and ending point, the type of the action, and the tile map it's referring to.
  The object is responsible for performing micro-level planning.
  It fires events to an Actor object so that it can carry out 
  the corresponding actions (jumping or moving, etc).

<h2>Is This Smarter than Humans?</h2>

<p>
Unfortunately, no.  Due to computational limits, the current
implementation considers only a handful of ways of possible jumps at
each position. Since it uses a rectangle as an approximation of jump
trajectory, it cannot emulate a complex manuever that humans could
do. Also, since it's on block-by-block basis, it cannot consider a
possibility of barely-make-it kinds of jumps. These are mostly
complexity problems, but in some cases there might be need to give up
to find an optimal solution.
